### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is A.R.'s repo with the projects I've been working on. It took a while to work on in-depth personal projects beyond the simple model building or data wrangling attempts that I was more familiar with. <br>
This time around, the goal is to work on projects that can provide depth and not just breadth. <br>
At this time, core focus areas include NLP, advanced EDA using automation, and end-to-end model deployment.
